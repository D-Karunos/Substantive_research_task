After reading the task my first instinct was to create a code, that would allow me to migrate data to MySQL database and just pull data from there using SUM function.

But I thought, that task is made for a different reason (use PHP, Python) so I just decided to get to an answer in a simple way. 

Step one: Collect all ID's and only ID's. (I can create name array for myself to add in tables and Dates are not required in this task)

Step Two: Use Array Count function to get a ammount of all ID's.

Step Three: Get all array lenght for average.

Step Four: Devide Every ID count number with all array lenght and multiply by 100% to get percentage.


FUTURE PLANS

For the future if client is going to use the data I might recommend creating charts for them to see and compare in an easier way than just comparing the numbers.
Also because Database contains dates when every interactions happened it would be fun to create a chart where client can compare when and how many times there were interactions in different months.

Hope you will like my ideas :)
