# Substantive_research_task

Welcome to my Substantive research task.

My code is written in PHP language so if you would want to execute it I would recomment downloading Apache server.
I am using XAMPP to execute all my PHP files. 

You can download XAMPP from here: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

After installing XAMPP put "ineractions.csv" and "index.php" files in htdocs folder and open localhost page on your browser.

Enjoy :)
